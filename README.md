# Self evaluation

We feel like we did a pretty solid job working on this project, since we worked well together, we finished on time and we completed all the requirements. Though we didn't add any extra features, therefore we only did what we were supposed to do. But we are satisfied with what we programmed.
Our time management could have been better though, we did basically everything today and the past few times we were trying to make the project work, so we did have some difficulties. But at the end we finished with barely any stress.
